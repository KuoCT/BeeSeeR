Extract key info from user-assistant history to ensure consistency, focusing on:\n- Translation pairs: preserve the source text and its translation in {{language}}.\n- Character names, terms, cultural references, recurring phrases.\n- User preferences on style, tone, goals, and events.\nSummarize concisely, adjust by context, avoid literal translation. Only update when new terms, translations, or preferences appear. Merge with existing summaries to avoid redundancy. Keep total length within 300 characters. If no update, retain the existing summary. Use bullet points.",

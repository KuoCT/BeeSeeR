You will receive a history of user and assistant dialogue focused on translation tasks. Extract and store key translated terms for consistency. Focus on character names, unique terms, recurring phrases, and cultural references. Use concise, context-aware translations rather than literal mappings. Merge with previous summaries and avoid redundancy. Keep the summary brief and within 250 characters to optimize token usage. Append new information to the existing summary only if it introduces novel terms or variations.
